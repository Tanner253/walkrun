## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier works)
- Solana wallet (Phantom or Solflare) for playing with save features

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd walkrun
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up MongoDB:**
   - Create account at [mongodb.com/atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas)
   - Create a cluster (free M0 tier works)
   - Get connection string

4. **Configure environment:**
   
Create `.env.local` in project root:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://USER:PASS@cluster.mongodb.net/voxelroad?retryWrites=true&w=majority
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

See `MONGODB_ENV_TEMPLATE.md` for detailed setup.

5. **Run the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Open the game:**
   
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

7. **Connect your wallet (optional):**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" button (top-right)
   - Select Phantom or Solflare
   - Approve connection
   - Your progress will now save to MongoDB!

### Guest Mode (No Wallet)

You can play immediately without connecting a wallet, but your progress won't be saved and you can't win SOL prizes.

## Deployment to Vercel

### Option 1: Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Deploy:
```bash

## Customization

### Adding More Characters

Edit `public/voxel-game.html` and add new entries to the `CharacterDefinitions` object:

```javascript
'my_char': {
  name: "My Character",
  rarity: "common", // common, rare, legendary, mythic
  build: () => {
    const g = new THREE.Group();
    // Add voxel boxes to create your character
    g.add(createBox(Materials.white, 25, 25, 25, 0, 12.5, 0));
    return g;
  }
}
```

### Adjusting Difficulty

In `public/voxel-game.html`, modify:
- `LANE_SIZE` - Distance between lanes
- `MOVE_TIME` - Speed of player movement
- Lane spawn rates in the `Lane` class

### Changing Prize Costs

Modify `PRIZE_COST` constant in the game file.
